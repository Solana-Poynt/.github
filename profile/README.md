## Hi there 👋 Welcome to Poynt. 
# Poynt: Subsidizing Commute Costs with In-Transit Advertising

Poynt is a product that seamlessly blends ride-hailing with in-transit advertising, built on the Solana blockchain. We offer a unique solution that reduces commute costs for passengers through optional ad viewing, creating a win-win scenario for riders, drivers, and advertisers.

## 🚀 What is Poynt?

Poynt is not just another ride-hailing app, nor is it a traditional advertising platform. It's a revolutionary concept that:

- Allows passengers to optionally watch short ads during their journey
- Provides immediate discounts on ride fares for ad viewers
- Utilizes blockchain technology for transparent and efficient transactions

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Ad-Supported Rides**: Passengers can choose to watch a short ad to receive a discount on their fare.
- **Flexible Choices**: Users decide whether to view ads or pay the full fare for each ride.
- **Blockchain-Powered**: Built on Solana for fast, low-cost transactions.
- **Embedded Wallet**: Seamless cryptocurrency transactions for users.
- **Driver Benefits**: Drivers receive a portion of ad revenue, enhancing their earning potential.
- **Targeted Advertising**: Businesses can reach consumers during their daily commutes.
