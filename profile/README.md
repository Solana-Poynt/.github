# Poynt: Building Attention Economy for Businesses

Poynt transforms passive ad viewing into active value creation for both brands and users. Our platform enables businesses to achieve measurable results through engagement-based advertising, while rewarding users with real value for their attention and actions.

## What Poynt Solves

The digital advertising industry faces a critical disconnect:
- Businesses spend billions ($237B estimated for 2025) on ineffective ads
- Users view 4000+ ads daily with zero benefit
- 30-40% of viewers find ad interfaces disruptive and annoying
- Traditional platforms deliver sub-0.1% clickthrough rates

## Our Approach

Poynt creates a value exchange ecosystem where:
- Users complete tailored tasks within a TikTok-style scrollable interface
